# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description:
In order to complete the assignment we had to make the website more accessible to screen readers and similar devices. Also we needed to make the website easier to read for future development.

## Steps Taken:
1. Replaced the div soup with proper semantic HTML tags
2. Restructured CSS Rules to remove repeated code
3. Added comments to be able to distinguish relationships between HTML and CSS code
4. Added a title and added alt tags to the images
